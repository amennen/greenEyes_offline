# greenEyes_offline
This repo contains scripts to analyze the previously collected dataset published in Yeshurun et al. (2017). The purpose of these scripts were to test different preprocessing parameters for classification, as well as to find which parts of the story to create ''stations''. For the real-time experiment repo, see https://github.com/amennen/greenEyes and for the BIDSifying related repo see https://github.com/amennen/greenEyes_BIDS.
